# Dev Portfolio
This repository contains several projects that best demonstrate my ability to write clean, modular, and robust code for low level managment.

## Projects

### Project 1: Direct-Mapped Write-Back Cache Trace-Based Simulation
Gathers statistics on a direct-mapped write-back cache with varying layer counts {1..3} through traces that simulate memory accesses. Used to provide insight into the efficiency of different configurations in regards to average memory access times. Configurable cache layer count, layer sizes, as well as line sizes.

### Project 2: Santa-Multi-Thread (Fix In Progress)
Utilizes multithreading and primitive synchornization techniques to simulate Santa's workshop, and present delivery process. A Hoare-Style monitor is used in order to synchronize threads representing Santa, his elves, and reindeer. Allows for configurable elv and reindeer thread counts, as well as number of deliveries made before jprogram termination.

### Project 3: Script
Program used to execute a given bash command, log its input, output, and errors to respective files, and display the command's output and errors in real-time to the terminal.

### Project 4: ...
